# Frontend: How to Implement Video Rendering (Beat-by-Beat)

This doc tells the frontend **how to render the bedtime story so it feels like a continuous video** even though the backend returns **one image per beat**. It covers the API contract, UX rules, and a step-by-step implementation.

**Related:** [STORY_FLOW.md](./STORY_FLOW.md) (end-to-end flow), [FRONTEND_API.md](./FRONTEND_API.md) (beat endpoint details).

## 1. Backend contract: no single video stream

The backend **does not** stream one video file. It works **beat-by-beat**:

- Each **`POST /api/story/beat`** returns **one** scene image + **one** narration + **one** narration audio URL.
- Generating a beat (Gemini + image) often takes **10–30 seconds**.
- The "video" is the **sequence** of these beats: image 1 + narration 1 → image 2 + narration 2 → …

So the frontend must:

1. Request beats (one at a time, or prefetch the next).
2. Display each beat's **image** and play its **narration audio** in order.
3. Avoid making the user feel a long "Creating scene…" stall between beats.

## 2. Target UX: continuous-feeling "video"

The story should feel like **one continuous video**, not "image, long wait, image, long wait":

- **Never** replace the whole screen with a full-screen "Creating scene... This may take 10-30 seconds" spinner.
- **Keep the last scene image visible** until the next one is ready.
- **Prefetch** the next beat while the current narration is playing so the gap between scenes is short (or zero).
- **Play narration as soon as you have it**; show the new image when it loads (or keep the previous image until then).
- Use a **small, non-blocking** loading state (e.g. "Drawing next scene…" overlay or corner spinner) so the current scene stays visible.

---

## 3. API: `POST /api/story/beat`

**Request:**

- **`action`** (string, required) — e.g. `"What happens next?"` or `"Begin the story"` for the first beat. For auto-continue, use `"What happens next?"`.
- **`campaignId`** (optional) — Omit to use default campaign.

**Response (200):**

| Field | Type | Use |
|-------|------|-----|
| `narration` | string | Story text for this beat. |
| `narrationAudioUrl` | string | Same-origin URL to play TTS for this narration. **Play this as soon as you have the response.** |
| `image` | `{ imageUrl, source }` | `imageUrl` = URL of the scene image. Display when loaded; keep previous image visible until then. |
| `imageUsedYourFace` | boolean | `true` if the scene used the user's face (Imagen customization). Use for "Your face in the story" UI. |
| `scene_prompt` | string | Backend's scene description (for debugging or captions). |
| `theme`, `mood`, `location`, etc. | various | Optional for UI (e.g. "Magical forest • Peaceful"). |

**Important:** Each beat is **independent**. There is no "stream"; you build the sequence by requesting beat 1, then beat 2, then beat 3, etc. Order is determined by **when you send the request** and **how you queue responses** (see below).

## 4. Implementation: step-by-step

### 4.1 State you need

- **Current beat index** (e.g. `beatIndex = 0` for first beat).
- **Current scene image URL** — the image to show right now (from the latest completed beat).
- **Current narration audio** — the audio element or URL for the current beat (so you can detect when it ends).
- **Prefetched next beat** (optional) — `{ narration, narrationAudioUrl, image }` for the next beat, if you already requested it.
- **Pending request** — whether a beat request is in flight (so you don't double-request).

### 4.2 Requesting the first beat

1. Call **`POST /api/story/beat`** with `{ action: "Begin the story" }` (or your first-action string).
2. When the response arrives:
   - Set **current scene image** = `response.image.imageUrl` (or show a placeholder until the image loads).
   - Start playing **`response.narrationAudioUrl`**.
   - Display **`response.narration`** text if you show subtitles/captions.
3. **Prefetch:** Right after you start playing narration, call **`POST /api/story/beat`** again with `{ action: "What happens next?" }` in the **background**. Store the response as "prefetched next beat" (do not display it yet).

### 4.3 When the current narration ends (auto-continue)

1. If you have a **prefetched next beat**:
   - Set **current scene image** = prefetched beat's `image.imageUrl` (or keep showing the previous image until the new one loads).
   - Start playing **prefetched beat's `narrationAudioUrl`**.
   - Display prefetched beat's **narration** text.
   - Clear the prefetched beat; **request the next beat** in the background again (`action: "What happens next?"`) and store as the new prefetched beat.
2. If you **don't** have a prefetched beat yet (e.g. first beat or prefetch failed):
   - **Keep showing the current scene image** (do not blank the screen).
   - Show a **small** loading state (e.g. "Drawing next scene…" or a spinner in the corner).
   - When the response arrives, set image, play narration, then prefetch the next beat as above.

### 4.4 Loading state (non-blocking)

- **Do not** show a full-screen "Creating scene... This may take 10-30 seconds" as the only content.
- **Do** keep the **last scene image** visible and overlay a small indicator (e.g. "Drawing next scene…", "Loading…", or a corner spinner).
- Optionally dim the image slightly or show a thin progress bar so the user knows something is loading, but the story never "disappears."

### 4.5 Ordering and race conditions

- Beats are ordered by **when the backend processes them**. If you send "What happens next?" once per narration end, order is correct.
- If you prefetch, **only use the prefetched beat when the current narration ends**. Don't show beat N+1 before beat N's narration has finished.
- If the user taps "Pause" or "Stop," cancel or ignore any in-flight prefetch and don't start new requests until they resume.

## 5. Minimal flow summary

```
1. Request beat 1 (action: "Begin the story").
2. On response: show image 1, play narrationAudioUrl 1, show narration 1.
3. Immediately prefetch beat 2 (action: "What happens next?").
4. When narration 1 ends:
   - If beat 2 ready: show image 2, play narration 2; prefetch beat 3.
   - If not ready: keep image 1 visible, show small "Drawing next scene…"; when beat 2 arrives, show image 2, play narration 2; prefetch beat 3.
5. Repeat from step 4 for beat 3, 4, …
```

Always **keep the previous image on screen** until the next image is ready. Always **prefetch the next beat** as soon as the current narration starts (or when the user enables "Auto"). That way the gap between scenes is minimal and the story feels continuous.

---

## 6. Optional: show narration before image loads

When you receive a new beat:

- **Play `narrationAudioUrl`** as soon as the response arrives.
- **Swap in `image.imageUrl`** when the image has loaded (or keep the previous image until the new one is ready).

So the story "keeps talking" even if the image is a bit slower to load.
